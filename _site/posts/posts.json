    "contents": "\r\nIntroduction\r\nMy first pass at creating a rating system is using the ever common\r\nELO system. You can find a lot about it online.\r\nEveryone starts at a 1500 rating and then the rating moves up (good) or\r\ndown based on results. Elo compares the ratings between two opponents\r\nand calculates the expected win percentage based on that delta. For\r\nexample one team with a rating of 1200 would have the same expected win\r\nrate playing an opponent of 1100, as a team ranked 1800 playing one with\r\na rating 1700. After the completion of the game, each teams rating is\r\nadjusted. If a team is a heavy favorite, the adjustment is minor, but if\r\nan underdog runs the adjust is large. The winning team always gains\r\nrating, and the losing teams loses. Elo is a zero sum calculation, so\r\nthe adjustment is the same for both teams.\r\nElo Calculation\r\nThe calculation for a team winning a game is \\[ P_a= \\frac{1}{1 + 10 ^ \\frac{R_b - R_a}{400}}\r\n\\].\r\nChecking the Accuracy\r\nLog Loss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIntroduction\r\nHello. My name is Colin Kohoutek and this is my blog on NCAA basketball. I currently have ELO ratings for menâ€™s and plan to add women and more advanced ratings systems. An ELO rating is a very common, simple method to rate opponents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). Basically you calculate the difference in rating between two teams to get an expected win percentage. A 100 point difference is a 64% win expectancy. Yuo then update the two ratings based on the outcome. The lower the expected win percentage the bigger rating boost if that team does win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
