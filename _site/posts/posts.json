    "contents": "\r\nIntroduction\r\nHello. My name is Colin Kohoutek and this is my blog on NCAA basketball. I currently have ELO ratings for menâ€™s and plan to add women and more advanced ratings systems. An ELO rating is a very common, simple method to rate opponents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). Basically you calculate the difference in rating between two teams to get an expected win percentage. A 100 point difference is a 64% win expectancy. Yuo then update the two ratings based on the outcome. The lower the expected win percentage the bigger rating boost if that team does win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
