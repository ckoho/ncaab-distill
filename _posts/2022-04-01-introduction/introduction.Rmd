# Introduction

Hello. My name is Colin Kohoutek and this is my blog on NCAA basketball. I currently have ELO ratings for men's and plan to add women and more advanced ratings systems.
An ELO rating is a very common, simple method to rate opponents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). IT was originall developed as a chess rating system. You calculate the difference in rating between two teams to get an expected win percentage. A 100 point difference is a 64% win expectancy. You then update the two ratings based on the outcome. The lower the expected win percentage the bigger rating boost if that team does win. I will go into how the adjustment is calculated in a future post.
